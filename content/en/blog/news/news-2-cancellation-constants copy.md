  Add new contents
---

We are very excited to announce the 0.2.0 release of the website. The news are:

- fix some typo errors
- add **Constants** content in the [basic section](/docs/basic-of-the-language/#constants)
- add **Cancellation** content in the [advanced section](/docs/advanced/go-routines/#managing-the-cancellation) to show how to interrupt 
  go routines execution


Stay connected and **happy coding**!
